ES6, A Look Into Your Future

* What is ES6?
  * The coming 6th edition of ECMAScript
  * ES is a standard
  * Implemented by vendors (Chrome, Firefox, Node.js, IE)

* History
  * In the beginning
    * Eich at Netscape mid 90's
    * Became a thing
    * Got standardized with ECMA
      * TC39 is the technical committee in charge

  * Changes
    * v2 for ISO
    * v3 brought try/catch, Regex, & other
    * v4 stalled out

  * Not to be
    * Netscape tanked, Microsoft soared, & dev stopped
    * Started again in 2005
    * Committee quickly split into to
      * One focused on large changes
      * The other on a smaller incremental change (ES3.1)

  * Harmony
    * In 2008 the groups were brought back together
    * ES4 was abandoned
    * ES5 was created as a compromise, mostly based on ES3.1
    * ES6 is a work to harmonize TC39 & the ECMAScript language
